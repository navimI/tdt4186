/*Based on the information you provided about the `tsched` function and its requirements, here's an example implementation of the `tsched` function that uses a round-robin scheduling algorithm to select the next thread to run:

```c
// Global variable to keep track of the currently running thread
int current_thread = -1;

void tsched()
{
    // Find the next runnable thread using a round-robin scheduling algorithm
    int next_thread = (current_thread + 1) % MAXTHREAD;
    while (threads[next_thread] == NULL || threads[next_thread]->state != RUNNABLE)
    {
        next_thread = (next_thread + 1) % MAXTHREAD;
        if (next_thread == current_thread)
        {
            // No runnable threads found
            return;
        }
    }

    // Switch to the next thread
    if (current_thread != -1)
    {
        tswtch(&threads[current_thread]->tcontext, &threads[next_thread]->tcontext);
    }
    current_thread = next_thread;
}
```

This implementation of `tsched` uses a global variable `current_thread` to keep track of the currently running thread. The `tsched` function starts by finding the next runnable thread using a round-robin scheduling algorithm. It does this by starting from the thread after the currently running thread (`current_thread + 1`) and iterating through all threads in the `threads` array until it finds a thread that is not `NULL` and has a state of `RUNNABLE`.

Once a runnable thread is found, the `tsched` function uses the `tswtch` function to switch to this thread. The `current_thread` variable is then updated to reflect the index of the newly selected thread.

Note that this implementation assumes that the `threads` array and the `tswtch` function are defined and implemented elsewhere in your code. You would need to provide these definitions and implementations for this version of `tsched` to work correctly.
